# Accident Data-Mining
This project is based on real world data involving road traffic accidents. All road traffic accidents involving casualties are logged and reported in Great Britain, along
with a majority of other non-fatal road traffic accidents. Every year, the government releases a large batch of data associated with these reports. In this assignment we will be using the data from 2020. The task is to advise government agencies about how to improve road safety and create a model that would predict such accidents and the injuries that they incur.
The project included Important tasks as Data Mining using sqlite3 in python, Data Cleaning, Association Pattern Mining using Apriori Algorithm.
