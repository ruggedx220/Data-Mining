# Accident Data-Mining
This project is based on real world data involving road traffic accidents. All road traffic accidents involving casualties are logged and reported in Great Britain, along
with a majority of other non-fatal road traffic accidents. Every year, the government releases a large batch of data associated with these reports. In this assignment we will be using the data from 2020. The task is to advise government agencies about how to improve road safety and create a model that would predict such accidents and the injuries that they incur.
# Tasks:
1. Data Mining using SQLite3 in Python: Utilizing SQLite3, a relational database management system, to extract and manipulate the data. Python is employed as the programming language to interface with SQLite3, allowing for efficient querying and analysis of the accident data.
2. Data Mining using SQLite3 in Python: Utilizing SQLite3, a relational database management system, to extract and manipulate the data. Python is employed as the programming language to interface with SQLite3, allowing for efficient querying and analysis of the accident data.
3. Association Pattern Mining using Apriori Algorithm: The Apriori algorithm is employed for association pattern mining. This involves identifying patterns and relationships within the accident data, especially focusing on factors that might contribute to accidents or specific types of injuries. The algorithm helps discover associations, dependencies, and correlations among various attributes in the dataset.
4. Predictive Modeling: Developing a predictive model to forecast road traffic accidents and predict the injuries they might cause. This likely involves employing machine learning techniques, as well as potentially using historical accident data to train and validate the model. The model can serve as a valuable tool for government agencies to anticipate and mitigate potential risks on the roads.
5. Recommendations for Road Safety Improvement: Based on the insights gained from data mining and predictive modeling, the project aims to provide concrete recommendations to government agencies for improving road safety. These recommendations could include targeted interventions, infrastructure improvements, or public awareness campaigns.
